      <h1>Description of the Problem</h1>
      <p>An information problem that is unaddressed is the problem of having a place to store your solve times. It's not that hard to just press start and stop on a timer. The main problem is storing your times. In official cubing competitions, your average of 5 solves is also recorded. It's a lot more convenient if your timer could also average together the last 5, or even 12, solves to give you an idea of where your average is at.</p>
      <p>Another unaddressed information problem is that of information sharing involving cubing. Some cubers might be doing things that other cubers are not doing and vice versa. What cubers need is a good way to share their cubing knowledge with each other. It would also be possible for people to ask questions and other cubers could answer and give useful information. This would make the barrier to informamtion lower and it would give a lot more cubers access to information that would help them get faster solves.</p>

          <h1>App Ideas</h1>
          <p>My potential app idea would be a solve timer that could also store and average your solve times. This would make it possible to record your times and then you could get an average of your last 5 or 12 solves. It would also give you the fastest and slowest times you have recorded.</p>
