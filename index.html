        <h2>Why This Site Exists</h2>
        <p>A Rubiks's cube is a puzzle that is cube-shaped and consists of 26 individual smaller cubes that turn around a spindle. The goal of this puzzle is to make all 6 sides have a solid color on each side. There are over 43 Quintillion possible ways to mix it up. Some people have learned how to solve these puzzles and they are trying to get faster at solving them. These people are called cubers. Cubers have been trying to get faster for decades and they have seen a dramatic decrease in their solve times. The number of cubers has exploded and is still rapidly on the rise. Because the number of cubers are growing, they need better technology and better ways to approach cubing in general. </p>

        <h3>Why We Cube</h3>
        <p>People who consistently solved Rubik's Cubes are known as cubers. Typically, cubers try to improve their solve times so that they can solve their cube faster. Some people solve cubes because they like the rush they get when they beat their personal best time, other solve cubes because they just like to collect them. Often times, cubers go to officially organized competitions. Often times, cubers aren't really competing against each other, but they are competing against themsleves and their personal best times.</p>

        <h2>Fastest 3x3 Single Solves</h2>
        <p>The World Cube Association, WCA for short, is the official governing body for all things cubing. The only way somebody's solve time counts is if it happenend at an official WCA sanctioned cubing tournament. This list of the top 5 solve times was taken from the official WCA website.</p>
